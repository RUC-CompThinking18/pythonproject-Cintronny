# Comments
You had good comments throughout on the line-by-line intricacies of the program as well as some good introductory comments about the overall purpose of the program.

# Code Quality
The code that you wrote runs well and does what it needs to do. However, manually mixing things with the WordCloud generator is, in this case less effective for getting points in this category than the fight with TextBlob. It can be frustrating, but fighting with a library and getting it to do what you want is a major aspect of a project like this.

However, I will say that I do love your program's output: "until smarter loans go new school."

# Ambition
You have all my empathy in this category as I have a personal connection to doing this kind of work: as I've mentioned I have an ongoing project that does a somewhat more complex version of what you were trying to do here. It's hard, but I appreciate the way you tried to gather data and use it. It was a meaningful and ambitious project.
